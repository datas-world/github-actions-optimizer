# Security Incident Response Automation

This document explains the automated security incident response workflow for the GitHub Actions Optimizer project.

## Overview

The `security-incident-response.yml` workflow automatically creates GitHub issues and assigns them to Copilot when security incidents are detected.

## Triggers

The workflow is triggered by the following events:

### 1. Automatic Triggers

- **Code Scanning Alerts**: When CodeQL or other security scanners detect vulnerabilities
- **Secret Scanning Alerts**: When GitHub detects exposed secrets in the repository
- **Dependabot Alerts**: When vulnerable dependencies are found
- **Security and Analysis Events**: General security events from GitHub

### 2. Manual Trigger

You can manually trigger the workflow via GitHub Actions UI with:

- **Incident Type**: Choose from general, vulnerability, code-scanning, secret-leak, dependency, compliance
- **Description**: Describe the security incident
- **Severity**: Set as critical, high, medium, or low

## Automated Actions

When triggered, the workflow:

1. **Creates a GitHub Issue** with:
   - Descriptive title based on incident type
   - Detailed description with action items
   - Appropriate labels (security, severity level, type)
   - Auto-assignment to `@copilot`

2. **For High/Critical Severity**:
   - Adds `urgent` and `priority:high` labels
   - Creates an additional comment requesting immediate attention

3. **For Non-Secret Alerts**:
   - Assigns the issue to Copilot for automated resolution
   - Provides specific instructions for automated fix creation

## Issue Types Created

### Code Scanning Alerts

- Title: `üîí Code Scanning Alert: [Rule Description]`
- Includes: Rule details, severity, location, remediation steps
- Labels: `security`, `code-scanning`, `severity:[level]`

### Secret Scanning Alerts

- Title: `üîê Secret Scanning Alert: [Secret Type]`
- Includes: Urgent revocation steps, cleanup procedures
- Labels: `security`, `secret-scanning`, `severity:high`
- **Note**: These are NOT auto-assigned to Copilot due to sensitivity

### Dependabot Alerts

- Title: `üì¶ Dependabot Alert: [Package Name]`
- Includes: CVE details, version info, update steps
- Labels: `security`, `dependencies`, `dependabot`, `severity:[level]`

### Manual Reports

- Title: `üö® Security Incident: [Type]`
- Includes: Custom description, investigation steps
- Labels: `security`, `manual-report`, `severity:[level]`, `type:[incident_type]`

## Usage Examples

### Manual Trigger via GitHub UI

1. Go to Actions ‚Üí Security Incident Response
2. Click "Run workflow"
3. Fill in the incident details:
   - **Type**: vulnerability
   - **Description**: "Potential SQL injection in user input handler"
   - **Severity**: high
4. Click "Run workflow"

### Manual Trigger via GitHub CLI

```bash
gh workflow run security-incident-response.yml \
  -f incident_type=vulnerability \
  -f incident_description="Potential SQL injection in user input handler" \
  -f severity=high
```

## Copilot Integration

The workflow integrates with GitHub Copilot by:

1. **Auto-assigning** security issues to `@copilot`
2. **Providing context** and instructions for automated resolution
3. **Requesting specific actions**:
   - Analyze the vulnerability
   - Create pull requests with fixes
   - Add security tests
   - Update documentation

## Security Considerations

- **Permissions**: Workflow has minimal required permissions (contents: read, issues: write, security-events: read)
- **Action Pinning**: All actions are pinned to specific commit SHAs for security
- **Secret Handling**: Secret scanning alerts are flagged as high priority but not auto-assigned to prevent exposure
- **Audit Trail**: All automated actions are logged and traceable

## Customization

To customize the workflow:

1. **Add New Triggers**: Extend the `on:` section with additional event types
2. **Modify Issue Templates**: Update the JavaScript in the workflow to change issue content
3. **Adjust Labels**: Modify the label arrays for different categorization
4. **Change Assignees**: Update the `assignees` array to assign to different users/teams

## Monitoring

The workflow creates issues that serve as both:

- **Incident Records**: Permanent audit trail of security events
- **Action Items**: Trackable tasks for resolution
- **Metrics Source**: Data for security posture reporting

## Integration with Existing Workflows

This automation complements existing security measures:

- Works alongside pre-commit hooks
- Integrates with existing security scanning
- Provides escalation path for manual security reviews
- Feeds into security metrics and reporting
