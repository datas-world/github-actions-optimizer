# GitHub Actions Security Hardening

This document outlines the security hardening measures implemented in the GitHub Actions workflows for this repository.

## Security Measures Implemented

### 1. Action Pinning ✅

All GitHub Actions are pinned to specific commit SHAs to prevent supply chain attacks:

```yaml
- uses: actions/checkout@11bd71901bbe5b1630ceea73d27597364c9af683 # v4.2.2
- uses: actions/setup-python@0b93645e9fea7318ecaed2b359559ac225c90a2b # v5.3.0
```

**Benefits:**
- Prevents malicious updates to actions
- Ensures reproducible builds
- Protects against compromised action repositories

**Maintenance:** Version comments are included for easy identification during updates.

### 2. Explicit Permissions ✅

All workflows use explicit, minimal permissions following the principle of least privilege:

#### Workflow-level Permissions
```yaml
permissions: {} # Minimal default - jobs specify their own
```

#### Job-level Permissions
```yaml
permissions:
  contents: read      # Only what's needed for checkout
  actions: write     # Only for artifact uploads
  security-events: write  # Only for CodeQL results
```

**Benefits:**
- Reduces attack surface
- Prevents unauthorized repository access
- Limits potential damage from compromised workflows

### 3. Concurrency Controls ✅

All workflows implement concurrency controls to prevent resource abuse and race conditions:

```yaml
concurrency:
  group: ${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.ref }}
  cancel-in-progress: true
```

**Benefits:**
- Prevents redundant workflow runs
- Optimizes resource usage
- Reduces CI/CD costs
- Prevents race conditions

### 4. Secrets Management ✅

Proper secrets handling is implemented throughout:

- Use of GitHub secrets: `${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}`
- No hardcoded credentials or tokens
- Secrets are never logged or exposed

**Best Practices:**
- All secrets use GitHub's built-in secrets store
- Tokens have minimal required scopes
- No secrets in environment variables unless necessary

### 5. Runner Security ✅

Appropriate runner types are used based on security requirements:

- **ubuntu-latest**: Used for all jobs (cost-effective and secure)
- **Timeout limits**: All jobs have reasonable timeout limits (10-30 minutes)
- **No self-hosted runners**: Avoids potential security risks

### 6. Input Validation ✅

All user inputs and external data are properly handled:

- No direct injection of user-controlled data
- Proper escaping in shell commands
- Safe handling of GitHub event data

## Security Testing

Comprehensive security tests are implemented in `tests/test_security_hardening.py`:

- **Action pinning validation**: Ensures no @main/@master references
- **Permissions validation**: Checks for explicit, minimal permissions
- **Concurrency validation**: Verifies concurrency controls are present
- **Secrets validation**: Detects hardcoded credentials
- **Timeout validation**: Ensures reasonable timeout limits
- **Runner security validation**: Checks for appropriate runner usage

## Security Monitoring

The repository includes automated security monitoring:

- **CodeQL Analysis**: Static security analysis on schedule
- **Dependabot**: Automated dependency vulnerability scanning
- **Secret Scanning**: GitHub's secret detection
- **Workflow Failure Tracking**: Monitors for security-related failures

## Compliance Checklist

- [x] All actions pinned to commit SHAs
- [x] Explicit permissions for all workflows
- [x] Concurrency controls implemented
- [x] No hardcoded secrets or credentials
- [x] Appropriate runner types used
- [x] Timeout limits configured
- [x] Security tests implemented

## Maintenance

### Updating Pinned Actions

1. Check for new action versions regularly
2. Update commit SHA and version comment together
3. Test thoroughly before merging
4. Use tools like Dependabot for automation

### Permission Reviews

1. Regularly audit workflow permissions
2. Remove unnecessary permissions
3. Use job-level permissions when possible
4. Document any broad permissions with justification

### Security Monitoring

1. Review CodeQL results regularly
2. Address Dependabot alerts promptly
3. Monitor workflow failure patterns
4. Update security measures as needed
