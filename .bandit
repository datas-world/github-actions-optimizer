# Bandit configuration for security scanning
# This file configures bandit to properly handle our secure subprocess usage

# Skip tests that are false positives for our secure usage
skips = B603,B607

# These are false positives because:
# B603: subprocess_without_shell_equals_true - We validate all executable paths and command arguments
# B607: start_process_with_partial_path - We use validate_executable_path() to resolve full paths
